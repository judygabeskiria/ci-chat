ci-chat
=======

A simple browser chat client for private chat in CodeIgniter.

This project is based on a tutorial called CodeIgniter Chat Application. 
The website no longer exists although video can be found on YouTube by the original creator Alasdair Boyd.

I found it as a useful exercise and have also implemented it in projects that dont require the lifting
or additional maintenance of XMPP or NodeJS.

I will provide database creation scripts if needed. Of course you can structure it to suit your needs.

Good Luck
